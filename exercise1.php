/* EXERCISE 1

Remember for now we will use properties and methods that can be accessed from everywhere.
TODO: Make a getInfo function which returns "This beverage is <temperature> and <color>."
TODO: Instantiate an object which represents cola. Make sure that the color is set to black, the price equals 2 euro and the temperature to cold automatically
 print the getInfo on the screen.
TODO: Print the temperature on the screen.

USE TYPEHINTING EVERYWHERE!
